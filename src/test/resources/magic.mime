# Magic data for MimeUtil (originally for UNIX file(1) command)
#
# This is an extension or override file for the Unic magic.mime
# It is read in by MimeUtil class BEFORE the unix or included magic.mime
# It has exactly the same format as the unix magic.mime
#
# The format is 4-5 columns:
#    Column #1: byte number to begin checking from, ">" indicates continuation
#    Column #2: type of data to match
#    Column #3: contents of data to match
#    Column #4: MIME type of result
#    Column #5: MIME encoding of result (optional)
#
#	NOTE: 	This parser has extended functionality beyond the normal magic.mime
#			field descriptions.
#
# This file shows the extension to the format used by magic.mime it works as follows
#	The string type can be followed by the sequence '>#<' where the '#' represents a
#	number of bytes to read.
#	The '>' and '<' characters around the number mean BETWEEN.
#		As an example of this feature see the #SVG file format description below....

#SVG Image Format
#	As the XML declaration in an XML file can be short or extended we cannot know
#	exactly where the declaration ends i.e. how long it is,
#	also it could be terminated with by new line(s) or a space(s).
#	So the next line states that somewhere within the first 1K block of characters we
#	should find the DOCTYPE declaration for the SVG.
#	This DOCTYPE declaration should be within 1024 characters from the beginning of the file.
