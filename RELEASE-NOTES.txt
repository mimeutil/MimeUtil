 What is mime-util?
 It's a very small lightweight extensible utility that allows Java programs to detect mime types based on file extensions and magic numbers.
 The API supports java.io.File and java.io.InputStream. It reads the system's magic files as used by the Unix file(1) command when used on a Unix OS.
 For Windows, internal resources are included in the library.

 For a fuller description of mime-util please refer to the README.txt file distributed with the library.

 This file contains the release notes of each version of mime-util


 Version 1.3 Released xx-xx-2009

 This version represents a major refactoring of mime-util with many new features and a more flexible architecture.
 It will be the last version released in the 1.x branch. Some of the classes such as the MimeHandler are currently
 experimental and are not well documented. These classes are subject to major change when we release version 2.x
 and will have their API's pretty well defined.

 1. Depricated the eu.medsea.util.MimeUtil and eu.medsea.util.MimeException classes
 	These classes are still available but will not be supported any more. Please modify
 	your code to use the new eu.medsea.mimeutil.MimeUtil and eu.medsea.mimeutil.MimeException classes instead
 2. Added eu.medsea.mimeutil.MimeUtil to replace the depricated class
 3. Added eu.medsea.mimeutil.MimeException to replace the depricated class
 4. Added eu.medsea.mimeutil.MimeType class and eu.medsea.mimeutil.TextMimeType class to represent a mime types
 5. Added eu.medsea.mimeutil.MimeTypeHashSet to represent a Collection of mime types
 6. Added eu.medsea.mimeutil.detector.MimeDetect as an Abstract class to represent new plugable MimeDetector(s)
 7. Added eu.medsea.mimeutil.detector.ExtensionMimeDetect for detecting mime types from file extensions
 8. Added eu.medsea.mimeutil.detector.MagicMimeMimeDetector for detecting mime types from files, streams and URL,s
 	using magic number detection
 9. Added many new junit test cases to test the new methods
 10. Updated a lot of the java doc as well as the README.txt file



 Version 1.2 Released 27-01-2009

 1. This release has been restructured as a maven project


 Version 1.1 Released 21-01-2009

 1. Fixed all issues arising from version 1.0
 2. Added extensive javadoc
 3. Added many new features and methods
 4. Improved the parsing of the unix file(1) magic.mime files
 6. Extended the customisation features for both magic.mime files and file extension mappings
 7. Improved the build process
 8. Added many unit tests (these can be downloaded separately from the SVN repository)
 9. Improved the README documentation
 10. Improved the speed for identifying mime types
 11. Added the ability to detect the mime type of a stream


We are now actively working on version 2.0 which will include many new features including:
Deployable as an OSGI bundle
Packaged as a maven 2 project
Plugins for Eclipse and Freedesktop

Plus may more new features....


 Version 1.0 Released 07-09-2007

 1. Initial implementation of the mime detection utility library
