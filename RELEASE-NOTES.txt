 What is mime-util?
 It's a very small lightweight extensible utility that allows Java programs to detect mime types based on file extensions and magic numbers.
 The API supports java.io.File and java.io.InputStream. It reads the system's magic files as used by the Unix file(1) command when used on a Unix OS.
 For Windows, internal resources are included in the library.

 For a fuller description of mime-util please refer to the README.txt file distributed with the library.
